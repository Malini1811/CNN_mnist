# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project implements a neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Python and deep learning libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.

##  Project Overview

The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), each 28x28 pixels in size. The goal is to correctly classify the digits using a trained machine learning model.

##  Files

- `mnist_final.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all code for loading data, building the model, training, evaluation, and predictions.

##  Key Features

- Preprocessing of image data
- Creation and training of a neural network model
- Evaluation using test data
- Visualization of model performance

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (recommended: Python 3.8+).
3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
    ```
4. Run the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook mnist_final.ipynb
    ```

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy (typically above 97%) on the MNIST test set. You can tune the architecture or training parameters for better performance.
